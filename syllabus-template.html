                        <p class="h2">Course Objectives</p>
                        <p>
                        In this course, students will be introduced to "educational data science", a new, rapidly growing field that brings together the brightest minds of mathematics, 
                        computing, and education to solve real-world problems in teaching, learning, and educational improvement. While this course will introduce educational data science more broadly, we will use the context of the <i>Fraction Ball: Out of Bounds</i> video game as a motivating example. This course may be understood through 3 parts:</p>
                        <p class="h4">Part 1: Building Blocks, Weeks 1-3</p>
                        <p>
                        In this part of the course, students develop a surface level understanding of data science and the study of learning. Specifically, students will look at how learning is understood in a variety of contexts, and how data science
                        allows researchers to uncover patterns, predictions, and hidden structures within these contexts.
                        In addition, students will be introduced to the Python programming language for data analysis, run basic descriptive statistics, and create simple visualizations with simple datasets.</p>
                        <p class="h4">Part 2: Going Deeper, Weeks 4-7</p>
                        <p>
                        In this part of the course, students will gain a deeper understanding of how educational data science may be used to study latent, or hidden, phenomena. Specifically, students will be able to focus on executive functions in context, and how data collected from video games may
                        be used to study that context. Students will also get more experience with data processing through Python, and practice describing results to others.</p>
                        <p class="h4">Part 3: Tying it All Together, Weeks 7-10</p>
                        <p>In this part of the course, students will create their own datasets using the <i>Fraction Ball: Out of Bounds</i> video game. Students will work together, in groups of 4, to apply the data analysis
                            techniques learned from the course to clean, visualize, describe, and produce a simple model of an executive function of their choice. Students will present their findings during week 10 of the course.</p>
                    
                        </p>
                        <p class="h2">Prerequisites</p>
                        <p>Course restricted to Educational Sciences, Computer Science, Statistics, Data Science, or Informatics majors.</p>
                        <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
                            It is strongly recommended that students take an introductory statistics course before this course.

                          <p class="h2">Materials</p>
                          <p>Students should bring a fully charged laptop computer to class. Laptops can be rented through the <a href="https://www.lib.uci.edu/mrc/mrc-laptops-and-mobile-devices">UCI Library</a>. All reading materials will be provided on the course websites.</p>

                          <p>Attendance and participation will be worth <b><i>20%</i></b> of your grade. It is very important that you attend all of class. Of course, life happens and I want to ackowledge the situation we are in. Thus, two absences per quarter will not be penalized.</p>

                          <p>Here’s how many points you will recieve in the following scenarios:</p>

                            <li> 0 points for not attending, with no prior notice</li>

                            Although class recordings will be uploaded for those who miss, and for those who want to review, <b>do not use the recordings as an excuse for missing class or not participating</b>. I caution strongly against doing this for your other courses, and that behavior will severely hurt you in this course.

                    <div class="h2">Academic Honesty and Policies</div>
                    <p>Academic honesty is something we take very seriously at UCI and in this course. Academic dishonesty is something that affects you as a learner and affects how others around you learn.
                        Students who engage in academic dishoensty, including cheating, directly copying other students' work or code, will face punishments by the UCI Academic Senate. 
                        This is a part that many students skim over. The fact that you've read this shows you are paying attention to the things that matter. Since you've read this, send me a knock knock joke through email by the end of Week One, and you will be rewarded five dollars. It pays to pay attention.
                        Students have responsibility to: (1) refrain from cheating and
                        plagiarism; (2) refuse to aid or abet any form of academic dishonesty; and (3) notify professors
                        and/or appropriate administrative officials about observed incidents of academic misconduct.
                        The anonymity of a student reporting an incident of academic dishonesty will be protected. For
                        further information, please consult the UCI Academic Senate Policies on Academic Honesty in
                        the<a href="https://aisc.uci.edu/resources/reporting.php">UCI Office of Academic Integrity and Student Conduct</a>.</p>

                        <p><i>A note on code:</i> it's common practice to take code from other sources, including StackOverflow and GitHub at academic and professional levels. In our assignments, including for the final project, you may use code that is 
                        publicly available so long as you provide a link to where it came from.  The code <b>must not be written by another student</b>. Here's a citation you might use:

                    <p>College can, and will be a stressful, intense experience. It can also be very isolating and may challenge 
                    you in new and difficult ways that take a toll on your physical and health. The <a href="http://www.counseling.uci.edu/">UCI Counseling 
                    Center</a>, is an excellent resource for a variety of services related to mental health needs that may 
                    arise.</p>

                    <p>Any student who needs accommodations related to disabilities is encouraged to contact the 
                    <a href="">Disability Services Center (DSC)</a> for assistance with accessibility issues, learning accommodations, 
                    and documentation. Likewise, students who become injured while at UCI or who are in need of
