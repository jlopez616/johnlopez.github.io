        <p class="card-text">The StoneScript Project is a research project dedicated to the research, documentation,
        and translation of the world's oldest coding language, StoneScript. Believed to have originated over 10,000
        years ago in the middle of the Stone Age, the language has only been recently rediscovered after ancient stone
        tablets containing the language were found. The purpose of the tablets remains a mystery that the project aims
        to solve by recreating the primitive language and a working compiler using modern Ohm and JavaScript tools</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">What can StoneScript do?</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Our department believes that if StoneScript was to be created today, it would draw inspiration from
        Haskell, JavaScript, and Python. Early analysis shows that the cavemen creators did not have a thorough understanding of
        of types, as the language only weakly supports the the simplest of types. However they did include arrays, having only recently
        discovered them, and thinking them to be the hottest thing since fire! Early translations show that StoneScript is not a visually
        pleasing language, being particularly hard to read and write, but we have concluded that it is the best language to yell at anything.</p>
