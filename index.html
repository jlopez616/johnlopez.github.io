    <div id="about" class="content">
        <p>I am a senior computer science major and a Ronald E. McNair Scholar at Loyola Marymount University, a Jesuit college in 
            Los Angeles, California. </p>
        
        <p>This fall I will be attending the University of California, Irvine, to begin a Ph.D. program in Education. My advisor will be <a href="https://www.ahnjune.com">Dr. June Ahn</a>.</p>

        <p> My Jesuit education had a strong emphasis on service, which requires a strong understanding of the needs of the communities one serves with and for. This service foundation
            is what drives me to do research - I believe that in order to create real solutions to 
            facilitate learning, it’s necessary to understand how previous systems may have 
            addressed or failed to address the social, economic, or cultural underlying issues in a community. 
            I desire to make education and technology more accessible to those around the world, 
            and I aim to have my work help bridge the social and economic barriers that prevent 
            others from fulfilling their dreams.</p>

                    <p>For my senior project, I am collaborating with several LMU students to develop Ballona Discovery, a content management
                        system for the <a target="blank" href="https://www.ballonafriends.org">Ballona Discovery Park</a>. Park staff and volunteers will be able to use a web based interface to design and publish 
                        interpretive and interactive mobile web pages - without writing a single line of code! These pages will be visible through "tours" 
                        as guests walk through the park.</p>
                    <p>The project will be launched in early summer, 2020. You may view its demo at <a target="blank" href="https://ballona-discovery.herokuapp.com">our website</a>.

                        During my junior year, I became a Peer Scholar/Teaching Assistant, where I helped teach by LIBA 1001 and 1002 by facilitating discussions, giving presentations,
