    <div id="about" class="content">
        <p>I am a senior computer science major at Loyola Marymount University, a Jesuit college in 
            Los Angeles, California. I seek to enroll in a Ph.D. program to make
            education and technology more accessible to those around the world, 
            and I aim to have my work help bridge the social and economic barriers that prevent 
            others from fulfilling their dreams. </p>

                <p>For my senior project, I am collaborating with Anthony Boyac and Jialing Li to develop Ballona Discovery, a content management
                    system for the Ballona Discovery Park. Park staff and volunteers will be able to use a web based interface to design and publish 
                    interpretive and interactive mobile web pages - without writing a single line of code! These pages will be visible through "tours" 
                    as guests walk through the park.</p>
                <p>The project will be launched in early December, 2019. You may follow its progress on our GitHub.</p>

                        Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) at the University of Florida. This project, in collaboration with the 
                        LearnDialogue Group, investigated the abilites and perceptions of novice computer science students when debugging programs
                        using Block-Based and Hybrid environments.

                    GRNsight is a web application created by Dr. Kam Dahlquist and Dr. John David Dionisio at Loyola Marymount University for
                    visualizing gene regulatory networks. As a member of the GRNsight development team, I performed several debugging tasks to improve the robustness
                    of the software, and I implemented an interactive Gene Pages feature.
